Alpha process
C + he = O
O + he = Ne

Ne + He = Mg
Mg + He = Si

Oxygen Burning
O + O -> P + H
O + O -> Mg + 2 He

Silicon Burning - Also the alpha process
Si + He = S
S + He = Ar
Ar + He = Ca 
Ca + He = Ti 
Ti + He = Cr 
Cr + He = Fe 
Fe + he = Ni

Carbon Burning 
C + C = Ne + He
C + C = Na + H
C + C = Mg 
Advanced Nucleur burning
C + O = Si
O + O = S
Si + Si = Fe

Triple alpha process
He + He + He = C
